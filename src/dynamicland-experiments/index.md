# Dynamicland & me

The work on this page requires a little context. These research & art projects were all made at [Dynamicland](https://dynamicland.org/). The space uses cameras, projectors, and a custom language to facilitate turning the environment (walls, tables, anything you can stick a piece of paper onto) into a programmable space. For more detail I'd encourage you to read [Omar Rizwan's project-based explanation of the space](https://rsnous.com/posts/notes-from-dynamicland-geokit/). He goes a little into Realtalk, the superset of Lua that Dynamicland is built with. It's a research lab started by Bret Victor, an intentional community, a gathering space, a learning space, and someday I'll write more about it. For now, here are some things I've made there in the context of research, education, art, and exploration:

- [Video of a live scrubbing numbers interface controlled with my nails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYaZ7dZWEBc)
- [_Iambicland_](https://twitter.com/acwervo/status/990650486779883520) - a pun that turned into an interesting little experiment using small cubes to specify a number, specifically what [Shakespeare sonnet](http://shakespeare.mit.edu/Poetry/sonnets.html) you'd like to see.

ADD IMAGES of live patching, give each one in this list its own h2??

- Live patching numbers in Realtalk programs to generate random variations: [example 1](https://twitter.com/acwervo/status/1020854349302509574), [example 2](https://twitter.com/acwervo/status/1022342475329884160).
    - Motivating question: can we spatialize genetic programming?
    - Further, could we use a spatial interface & negotiation between steps in the randomization to produce a system for influencing genetic programming in a way that's inaccessible when you cannot be "inside" the computer as with Dynamicland?
