## Lessons from Lego & Logo

The seed of this all began when I started playing around with [Baku89](https://twitter.com/_baku89)'s lovely [pentool](https://s.baku89.com/pentool/):

There's a lot going on here:

- you can draw using a selected tool
- you can see the code the current tool is using (& edit & update it!)
- you can dynamically update the parameters of tool (e.g. color)
- (not shown) you can edit the code of the currently running tool
- (not shown) maybe most exciting, you can make your own tool/brush just by clicking the `+` button!

I was reading an email response from [Geoffrey Litt](http://geoffreylitt.com/) when I got the idea after reading this:

> The Pen Tool demo is fascinating. It's truly "open source" since it actively
> encourages the user to add new code and remix the software.. feels like
> taking a small part of the Dynamicland ethos and making it available in a
> more traditional environment. Even if the source for the entire site isn't
> open, I prefer this sort of thoughtful openness to "I threw the source on
> Github, you can try to read it if you want"...  I've seen kids hit the
> "remix" button in Scratch before and be totally overwhelmed by seeing 100s of
> blocks, it would be much better if they could have a nice guided onramp into
> modding an existing program.



## Gestalt (noun): _an organized whole that is perceived as more than the sum of its parts._

There's a lot to unpack here, this but it made me realized, all at once, that
part of what makes the Pen Tool's extensibility so _usable_ is that it exploits
the concept of the gestalt to its advantage, rather than attempting too limit
it to "simplified" small units, like Scratch.
