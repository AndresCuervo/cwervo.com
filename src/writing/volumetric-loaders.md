Loading animations are important for signaling to a user that a system is taking action. I wanted to take a more educational approach to my work in webVR, so I used Glitch to make a few simple loading animations in a webVR scene. My intention is for people to view the code in the Glitch project, hit \"View Source\", & navigate to <code>/public/loaders/index.html</code>  to inspect my code as an example. Using Glitch, you can also \"remix\" the code, so that a student can build off these examples. You'll see it's a simple set of A-Frame VR primitives combined with various delays to achieve sequential animations.
