## The Breakout Session

[Here's our notes from the breakout
session](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IW-1tPHt4_pAobdyHjF2kU3-ZZkfjl36jgR7F0oOA3M/edit?usp=sharing).
One note that kept coming up as we went through the [XAUR
Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/wiki/Xaur_draft#XR_Checkpoints_DRAFT) was
that not all XR applications are going to need, or even be able to meet, all
these guidelines. A VR game with an AR mode should make it so that its possible
to play the _core_ VR game but it may be impossible, with todays current
technology, to meaningfully make a positional AR viewer accessible to those with
low or no vision. Still, just because it's complicated doesn't mean we shouldn't
be doing it!
