## Pretty pictures

In February of this year I went to JSConf Hawai'i &amp; it was one of the best
conferences of my life! This is partly to do with, sure, the view outside my
hotel looked like this:

<div class="caption">View outside my hotel</div>

& the beach was just breathtaking (all the photos below were weird,
experimental panoramas, but you can still see how the ocean went on forever &
the sunset was gooooorgeous!)

The speakers were incredible, I made some very close friends, & worked on a talk
that solidified my passion for Web XR (more on that later).

## Miscellaneous good things

The badges were dope:

Oh, and also, there was this:

A depth photo I took of <a href="https://twitter.com/chromakode">Max
Goodhart</a> eating ice cream. The pink things in the background are flowers of
an indoor tree.

There were these wild albino pigeons (I think that's what they were? If not let me know!):

# My talk at JSConf Hawai'i

The talk I went to Hawai'i to give was "The Immersive Web in 2019":

The talk stressed me out for months because I gave it such a grandiose name but
in the end I'm happy with how it came out! People came up to me afterward & said
they actually learned some new things & a couple people even said they'd give
WebVR a try in their free time! So much has changed in the 10 months since I
gave that talk that it's not worth summarizing here, but if you're interested
in a high level overview of all the ways to use WebXR in 2019 do give the talk
above a watch & feel free to [email or DM me](https://cwervo.com/contact/) if
you have questions!

I'll be at JSConf 2020 as an attendee & I'm (surprisingly!) relieved my talk proposal
didn't get accepted because I'm excited to experience Hawai'i & JSConf HI
without the stress of giving a talk. If you're going next year too let me know!
