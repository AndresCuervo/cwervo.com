## Pretty pictures

In February of this year I went to JSConf Hawai'i &amp; it was one of the best
conferences of my life! This is partly to do with, sure, the view outside my
hotel looked like this:

<div class="caption">View outside my hotel</div>

& the beach was just breathtaking (all the photos below were weird,
experimental panoramas, but you can still see how the ocean went on forever &
the sunset was gooooorgeous!)

The speakers were incredible, I made some very close friends, & worked on a talk
that solidified my passion for Web XR (more on that later).

## Miscellaneous good things

Oh, and also, there was this:

Goodhart</a> eating ice cream. The pink things in the background are flowers of
an indoor tree.

& the badges were dope:

There were these wild albino pigeons (I think that's what they were? If not let me know!):

The talk I went to Hawai'i to give was "The Immersive Web in 2019":

The talk stressed me out for months because I gave it such a grandiose name but in the end
