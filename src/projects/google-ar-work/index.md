From February to December 2018 I worked at Google on AR prototyping, iterating
on filters with my art director [Erik Carter](https://erikcarter.net/#/). I
used [OpenFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) to create iOS & MacOS
prototypes for us to allow us to rapidly modify the UX, performance
constraints, and design of effects. Below are a few of the prototypes & effects!
